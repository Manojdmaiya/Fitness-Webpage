# Fitness-Webpage
This is my first SELF-MADE Front End web-page and  I designed it using HTML,CSS which is not a part of the course . I took the help of some color combinations from the internet , imported some nice google fonts and designed a fitness web page which resembles real - world Website . If you want to check the working of the webpage , download all the resources and run it on browser!! ðŸ˜‰
